Restaurant Rating Project Overview
In this project, various data analysis tasks were performed on a restaurant dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective was to extract meaningful insights regarding restaurant cuisines, locations, price ranges, online delivery options, and customer reviews. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the tasks and their respective analyses:

Level 1 Analysis
Task 1: City Analysis
Identify the City with the Most Restaurants:

Analyzed the dataset to find the city with the highest number of restaurants.
Result: Identified the top city with the most restaurant establishments.
Calculate Average Rating per City:

Computed the average rating for restaurants in each city.
Result: Provided a ranking of cities based on their average restaurant ratings.
Determine the City with the Highest Average Rating:

From the computed averages, pinpointed the city with the highest average restaurant rating.
Task 2: Price Range Distribution
Visualize Price Range Distribution:

Created histograms and bar charts to display the distribution of price ranges among restaurants.
Result: Visualizations highlighted the frequency of different price range categories.
Calculate Percentage of Restaurants in Each Price Range:

Calculated the proportion of restaurants falling into each price range category.
Task 3: Online Delivery Analysis
Percentage of Restaurants Offering Online Delivery:

Determined the percentage of restaurants providing online delivery services.
Compare Ratings:

Compared the average ratings of restaurants with online delivery to those without.
Result: Insights into whether offering online delivery correlates with higher or lower ratings.
Task 4: Restaurant Ratings Distribution
Analyze Rating Distribution:

Examined the distribution of aggregate ratings to find the most common rating range.
Result: Identified which rating range is most frequently given.
Average Number of Votes:

Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.
Level 2 Analysis
Task 1: Cuisine Combination Analysis
Identify Common Cuisine Combinations:

Analyzed the dataset to identify the most common combinations of cuisines offered by restaurants.
Result: Listed the popular cuisine combinations.
Cuisine Combinations and Ratings:

Determined if certain cuisine combinations tend to receive higher ratings.
Task 2: Geographic Analysis
Plot Restaurant Locations:
Used longitude and latitude coordinates to plot restaurant locations on a map.
Result: Visualized geographic patterns and clusters of restaurants.
Task 3: Restaurant Chains Analysis
Identify Restaurant Chains:
Identified restaurant chains present in the dataset.
Analyze Chain Ratings and Popularity:
Compared ratings and popularity metrics of different restaurant chains.
Level 3 Analysis
Task 1: Restaurant Reviews Analysis
Identify Common Review Keywords:

Performed text analysis on reviews to find the most frequent positive and negative keywords.
Review Length and Rating Relationship:

Explored the relationship between the length of reviews and their corresponding ratings.
Task 2: Votes Analysis
Identify Extremes in Votes:

Found the restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes.
Votes and Ratings Correlation:

Analyzed the correlation between the number of votes and restaurant ratings.
Task 3: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking
Relationship Between Price Range and Services:

Investigated if there is a relationship between restaurant price ranges and the availability of online delivery and table booking.
Service Availability in Higher Priced Restaurants:

Determined if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer online delivery and table booking services.
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to restaurant data analysis, offering valuable insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry using Python's powerful data analysis and visualization tools
